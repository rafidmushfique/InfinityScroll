# Infinity Scroll

In this project, I implimented infinity scroll for 200 data, Initally 40 data is displayed but when scrolled down other data are appended to the list gradually incrementing towards 200 data.

Used : PHP, JQuery,CSS,HTML

Databse folder contains the exported database in sql format.
 
Php_rest folder contains the code for the api I created to retrive information from the Databse.

WebFrontView contains the frontend view part.
